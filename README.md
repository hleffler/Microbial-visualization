# Microbial visualization
This repository is for a project with [REU Jetstream](https://jetstream-cloud.org/research/reu.php) program and the [National Center for Genome Analysis Support (NCGAS)](https://ncgas.org/). We utlize Jetstream, a cloud-based infrastructure that aids analysis of metagenomes. To learn more about Jetstream and how to get started, follow [this blogpost](https://blogs.iu.edu/ncgas/2017/10/18/getting-started-on-jetstream/) published by NCGAS.   

## Abstract
Metagenomes consist of the total genome content collected from an environmental sample containing bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences present. These datasets are complex and can be overwhelming to visualize. Using multiple visualization methods benefits researchers by allowing them to perform exploratory analyses that could aid in downstream analysis of the data. This paper focuses on using different visualization methods including a rarefaction curve, ordination plots, alluvial plot and heatmap to represent a metagenomic dataset using Jetstream. Applying the visualization methods on a hydrocarbon seepage metagenomic dataset, we found that the samples cluster based on location, one sample was similar to both reference and seep samples, and the datasets had human contamination. These findings can now lead to potential downstream analysis questions to further assess this data. The scripts and input files used to create the different visualizations are available on GitHub.

## Dependencies 
The visualization codes are written in R and can be run on either Rstudio or Jupyter Notebook.

### How to install Jupyter notebook
Jupyter notebook is a open-source project that allows code, text, images, and equations to be in one single document. To install Jupyter notebooks, follow [this blogpost](https://blogs.iu.edu/ncgas/2020/06/15/installing-jupyter-notebook-on-jetstream/).

### Input datasets 
The code was written for metagenomic datasets but is transferable to other datasets as well. 

### Taxanomic annotation 
Kraken2 is a taxonomic classification system that uses short genomic substrings (k-mer) matches. The k-mer is matched within a query sequence with the lowest common ancestor of all genomes containing the exact k-mer. Kraken is fast and provides a taxa report for each sample. This ste

### Test datasts
The test datasets are available in the folder [data_input](https://github.com/hleffler/Microbial-visualization/tree/master/input_data)

### Running the code on Jupyter Notebook 
The jupyter notebook can be downloaded and run on a local installation of the Jupyter notebook. To download the code,

` git clone https://github.com/hleffler/Microbial-visualization.git`
